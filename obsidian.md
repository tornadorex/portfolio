# Setting up a Knowledge Base with Obsidian

Welcome to this quick-start guide to setting up a personal knowledge base with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian is available for multiple platforms, including Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android. It’s the perfect place to gather thoughts or take notes, and it even allows you to sync your knowledge base across devices or publish it as a wiki or a website if that’s your thing. You can download it [here](https://obsidian.md/download) and follow instructions to install it on your preferred OS [here](https://help.obsidian.md/install).

This guide was written using the desktop version, so for mobile users your mileage may vary, especially for things that require keyboard keys like Ctrl/Cmd.

## Get Started

When you’re ready to get started, open Obsidian. When it first opens, you’re prompted to add a new vault. A vault is just a folder where Obsidian stores your notes, so you have the option to create a new empty vault or use an existing folder.

### Use an Existing Folder

1. Click **Open**.
2. Use the file browser to select the folder you want to use.

## Create a New Note

1. Press **Ctrl/Cmd+N**.
2. Enter a name for your note.
3. Start writing!

Obsidian supports Markdown syntax for formatting your text. If you’re unfamiliar with Markdown, I've put together a [cheat sheet for the basics](markdown-reference.html). Or if you prefer, you can select text and format it with keyboard shortcuts, or right click and select the formatting you want from the **Format** menu.

## Link to Other Notes

Obsidian supports wikilinks sytax&mdash;to link to another note, type its name surrounded by double brackets, like so: `[[my first note]]`. As you type, Obsidian tries to autofill with names that match to make the linking process easier.

To create a link to a note that has different text appear as the hyperlink, use this syntax: `[[name of the note|the text you want displayed]]`.

If you enter the name of a non-existent note, Obsidian creates the link with a more muted color, to indicate no note with that name exists. If you click the name while holding Ctrl/Cmd, Obsidian opens a new note with that name so you can begin editing it.

> **TIP**: To create an external link, use standard Markdown syntax for links&mdash;single brackets and parentheses, like so: `[the text you want displayed](https://example.com)`.


## What’s Next

There’s a lot more you can do than what’s contained in this guide, but you should be off to a good start now. For more information on using Obsidian’s range of functionality, including importing notes from other systems, see their [comprehensive help](https://help.obsidian.md/).
