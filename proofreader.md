1) The reading level for the text. Use Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, and Linsear Write. Provide an explanation of how or why you reached that reading level. Ignore technical terms and jargon when evaluating the reading level: I'm more concerned with general grammar, syntax, and sentence complexity. Present as a list.

2) Suggestions to improve readability. Provide a table of examples from the text and your suggestions to improve readability to grade 9 or 10. Include an explanation why this correction was suggested.

3) A summary of the ways to improve readability for this text. Provide a numbered list of specific strategies.

4) Specific suggestions to improve clarity and conciseness. Provide a table of examples from the text and your suggestions to improve clarity and conciseness without losing technical accuracy or being too informal. Include an explanation for each suggested revision.

5) Specific stylistic and consistency errors. Provide a table of that identifies the stylistic and consistency errors you found in the text, with suggestions how to correct them. Make these suggestions consistent with the style guide and the Microsoft Writing Style Guide. Ignore formatting suggestions like “make this text bold/italic,” as the pasted text may not be fully formatted.

For suggestions in tables, set up the table with the original text in one column, the suggested correction in another column, and the reason in a third column. Every suggestion or example you identify needs to come directly from the text provided. When you have finished, ask if I want you to expand on any section. Based on the number provided, expand on that section by including more examples from the text. Be exhaustive. No number of examples is too many, but they must all come directly from the text provided.
